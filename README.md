# Better Flying

**Hello!**

All this handling line does is modify the Airplane turning and removes turbulence from all air vehicles.

I have always been bothered in GTA the planes do not turn correctly. They can actually turn on a dime due to independent braking. _This fixes that._

```
How to install:

1. Download the ZIP
2. Unzip it to somewhere
3. Take the folder and drop it in your resources folder
4. Add this to server.cfg:
"start betterflying" without the quotes
```

**What does it look like though? Well like this:**
